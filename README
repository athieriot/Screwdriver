Goal:

   Ah, bullshit. Screwdriver is my excuse to learn some new technologies !
   So the purpose will evolve and that's it ;)

   Today, at the menu, I try to learn Bépo keyboard layout and I fall in love with games like ZType.

   Let's write a game !

   In the past. Another idea : 
   --Provide a web app to link together people who have ideas and people who doesn't.--
   --Most like Google Summer of Code than real job.--

Rules:

   - I think about plateform game or music game in wich the speed increase as you type.
   - Some diagrams to display, or a bonhomme.
   - Maybe, I can first try to make two or three lists of words. The first will be a complete text that create the floor and move forward the bonhomme.
   - There is, also, a list of words that make the dude jump and grab some bonuses.
   - An error wound the guy and you activate the bonus in tape words of the third list.
   - We can think of combo that accelarate the course of the man

   - OK ! Let's try that !

Tech:

   - Node.js
   - MongoDB
   - Nginx (maybe)
   - Want to play with socket.io
   - HTML5
   - Raphaël JS?

First:

   - Text writing
   - Get metrics
   - Don't forget unit tests
