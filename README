Goal:

   Ah, bullshit. Screwdriver is my excuse to learn some new technologies !
   So the purpose will evolve and that's it ;)

   Get back on the "no idea" concept.
   So, I not have a lot of ideas and I bet that I'm not the only one.
   Why not spend a small amount of my time writing tools to help guys to find ideas to work on.
   And maybe the opposite can help too. What if some guys have a lot of ideas and are not able to implement them !

   In the past. Another idea : 
   --Today, at the menu, I try to learn BÃ©po keyboard layout and I fall in love with games like ZType.--
   --Provide a web app to link together people who have ideas and people who doesn't.--
   --Most like Google Summer of Code than real job.--

Rules:

   - The idea to help create project is good but I wanted to help writing code
   - Why not be able to add some issues/bugs/ideas and give a note
   - The note has to be about complexity

   - Like that, anyone can see if he can help
   - Or if is project will be challenging

   - I can also build a command line tool that help bootstrap issue fixing

Tech:

   - Play 2.0
   - Twitter bootstrap
   - MongoDB/Lucene
   - Nginx
   - HTML5
   - Backbone/requirejs/handlebars

First:

   - Using Github API v3 to find issues and projects
