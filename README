Goal:

   Screwdriver is my excuse to learn some new technologies !
   So the purpose will evolve at my will ... maybe ;)

   So, I do not have a lot of ideas and I bet that I'm not the only one.
   Why not spend a small amount of my time writing tools to help guys to find ideas to work on.
   And maybe the opposite can help too. What if some guys have a lot of ideas and are not able to implement them !

   In the past. Another idea : 
   --Today, at the menu, I try to learn BÃ©po keyboard layout and I fall in love with games like ZType.--
   --Provide a web app to link together people who have ideas and people who doesn't.--
   --Most like Google Summer of Code than real job.--

Rules:

   - The idea to help create project is good but I wanted to help writing code
   - Why not be able to add some issues/bugs/ideas and give a note
   - The note has to be about complexity

   - Like that, anyone can see if he can help
   - Or if is project will be challenging

   - I can also build a command line tool that help bootstrap issue fixing

Todo:

   Features:

   - --Find repos on Github--
   - --Find people on Github--

   - Taking Gist in account
   - Start thinking about a better research (smarter like index descriptions and skills, add google code, bitbucket, selection of the user)
   - function of the project language, propose some reading or procs
   - Note on level of issues
   - Start thinking of a command line tool to help boostraping app or issues
   - Warning: Dont want to write a JIRA like site or eaven a trello
   - Linked in of drivers?
