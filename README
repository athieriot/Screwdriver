Goal:

   Ah, bullshit. Screwdriver is my excuse to learn some new technologies !
   So the purpose will evolve and that's it ;)

   Today, at the menu, I try to learn BÃ©po keyboard layout and I fall in love with games like ZType.

   Let's write a game !

   In the past. Another idea : 
   --Provide a web app to link together people who have ideas and people who doesn't.--
   --Most like Google Summer of Code than real job.--

Rules:

   Don't know yet

Tech:

   - Node.js
   - MongoDB
   - Nginx (maybe)
   - Want to play with socket.io
   - HTML5

First:

   - Text writing
   - Get metrics
   - Don't forget unit tests
